    <ul>
        <li>Automated likes, follows, or comments.</li>
        <li>Scraping TikTok user data beyond the API’s limitations.</li>
        <li>Bypassing TikTok’s content moderation policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Privacy and Data Security</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to These Terms</h2>
